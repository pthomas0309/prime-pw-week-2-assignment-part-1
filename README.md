# Prime Tier 1 Week 2 - Part 1

This week we introduced the programming language of the Internet, JavaScript. With JavaScript we can make our websites smart by adding interactivity and logic.

## Topics Covered
* Variables and Constants
* Conditional statements


## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started.

Remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go (just like you did to see your 'Hello World' last week!).

### Files Provided

This assignment you'll be completing the scripts in the following files. But note, that we have different levels of difficulty.

- [ ] *index.html* (You can put any questions you have in this file)
- [ ] *aboutMe.js* (Required Features, Stretch Goals)

The aboutMe.js file contains comments with prompts on what code to write. Do not erase the comments, just write the code below each commented line.

**NOTE:** The *aboutMe.js* file is already sourced into *index.html*. 


#### Levels of Difficulty

Below is a brief explanation of:

* what to expect when attempting each level
* if they are required or not

Level | Description
--- | ---
Required Features | required
Stretch Goals | optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research

### Instructions
Complete the `aboutMe.js` file.

There are additional step by step instructions in the file -- please use `console.log` after every step to check your work! 
Since some steps later in the file use results from earlier steps, you'll want to make sure things are right!

As you get to conditionals, sometimes there are multiple possibilities for how our code could execute. 
Try changing variables a bit to see if the code still works!

### Assignment Submission
Check in your repo, then turn in your work via the <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.primeacademy.io/#/student/assignments">Prime Academy Assignment Portal</a>, as usual and don't hesitate to hit up the Slack channel as needed!

**REMINDER**: Make sure to answer the Slack discussion question!

# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 12 Hour Sprint_

This project uses Javascript to write messages to the console and practice string concatenation. It also features different types of conditionals such as if/then statements, switch statements, and ternary operators.

## Screen Shot

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- Code editor of your choice
- Web Browser

## Installation

1. Download files.
2. Open the index.html file in the web browser.
3. Open the browser console to see the messages printed as well as changes the values of the variables to have different messages printed to the console.

## Usage

1. This project primarily utilizes the browser console, so to view any functionality the browser console must be open.
2. The messages printed to the console by adjusting the values of certain variables.

## Built With

HTML
Javascript
