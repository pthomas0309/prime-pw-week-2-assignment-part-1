# Prime Tier 1 Week 2 - Part 1

This week we introduced the programming language of the Internet, JavaScript. With JavaScript we can make our websites smart by adding interactivity and logic.

## Topics Covered
* Variables and Constants
* Conditional statements


## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started.

Remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go (just like you did to see your 'Hello World' last week!).

### Files Provided

This assignment you'll be completing the scripts in the following files. But note, that we have different levels of difficulty.

- [ ] *index.html* (You can put any questions you have in this file)
- [ ] *aboutMe.js* (Required Features, Stretch Goals)

The aboutMe.js file contains comments with prompts on what code to write. Do not erase the comments, just write the code below each commented line.

**NOTE:** The *aboutMe.js* file is already sourced into *index.html*. 


#### Levels of Difficulty

Below is a brief explanation of:

* what to expect when attempting each level
* if they are required or not

Level | Description
--- | ---
Required Features | required
Stretch Goals | optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research

### Instructions
Complete the `aboutMe.js` file.

There are additional step by step instructions in the file -- please use `console.log` after every step to check your work! 
Since some steps later in the file use results from earlier steps, you'll want to make sure things are right!

As you get to conditionals, sometimes there are multiple possibilities for how our code could execute. 
Try changing variables a bit to see if the code still works!

### Assignment Submission
Check in your repo, then turn in your work via the <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.primeacademy.io/#/student/assignments">Prime Academy Assignment Portal</a>, as usual and don't hesitate to hit up the Slack channel as needed!

**REMINDER**: Make sure to answer the Slack discussion question!

# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 12 Hour Sprint_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed aliquam at massa in faucibus. Etiam volutpat, risus non mollis convallis, velit nisi pulvinar mi, eu faucibus orci nisi eget nibh. Integer a velit pretium, volutpat arcu eleifend, fringilla elit. Cras erat sapien, convallis venenatis tellus vitae, feugiat dictum felis.

## Screen Shot

Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional). Remove if unused.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- List other prerequisites here

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
